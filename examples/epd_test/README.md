# Basic ePaper Example

This project is located in `examples/epd_test/`.

This example shows the basic usage of the ePaper display and the usage of the
framebuffer tool *YAFG* (Yet Another Font Generator).

## Usage
The ePaper periodically updates itself and increments a counter variable printed
to the display. While writing data via the SPI to the display LED D2 lights up.
